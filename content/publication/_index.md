## About My Work

My research focuses on the politics of education in the developing world. Specifically, I study how choices with regards to the education sector are the result of interactions between the political alignments of interest groups and electoral incentives. A second area of research of mine is political economy. To investigate these topics, I make use of mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, including interviews, archival work, large-N statistical work, and survey experiments. My newer area of focus is mis and disinformation in rich democracies.
