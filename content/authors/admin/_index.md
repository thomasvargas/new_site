I'm a Senior Researcher at Rethink Priorities where I support the Global Health and Development team. My published work explores the politics of education and issues in political economy.

I was born and raised in San Jos√©, Costa Rica before moving to the US for my university studies. I settled in Canada in 2020. A political scientist by training, my work appears in *Comparative Politics*, *World Development*, and other journals. Prior to grad school, I worked for two years for the MIT Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) in Santiago, Chile. I'm also an #rstats fan/evangelist.
