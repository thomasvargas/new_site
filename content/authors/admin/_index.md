I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Science at McMaster University, where I study education politics in Latin America and serve as Editorial Assistant for the *American Political Science Review*. I'm also an #rstats fan.

I obtained my PhD in Political Science from the University of Minnesota, where I had the pleasure of serving as Managing Editor for *Comparative Political Studies* from 2016-2018. Prior to graduate school, I worked for two years for the MIT Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) in Santiago, Chile.
